Hi there 👋. My name is Ziyue Zhu. I’m a CS MSC student at Fudan University, advised by Prof. Yixin Cao. Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in Shandong University.

My research lies in LLM/VLM-post training, including reasoning, alignment, evaluation, and applications. Recently, I am particularly focus on agent memory evaluation. 

🤝**I am actively seeking research collaborations and intern opportunities in LLM/VLM post-training, reinforcement learning, agents, and other exciting directions.**
